# Uber-Data-Analysis
A Machine Learning Project.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset. This is a data visualization project where we use visualisation 
libraries for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips. We are building a business 
model using which Uber can promote and develop their business.
The folder does not contain the datasets as they are very huge. The datasets can be downloaded from kaggle.com. This file contains the visualization
code for different months of the years 2014 and 2015. The code has been written in anaconda jupyter notebook.
